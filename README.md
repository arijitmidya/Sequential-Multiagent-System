# Sequential-Multiagent-System

Sequential Process Overview
The sequential process ensures tasks are executed one after the other, following a linear progression. This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order.

Key Features
Linear Task Flow: Ensures orderly progression by handling tasks in a predetermined sequence.
Simplicity: Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step tasks.
Easy Monitoring: Facilitates easy tracking of task completion and project progress.

Advanced Features
â€‹
Task Delegation
In sequential processes, if an agent has allow_delegation set to True, they can delegate tasks to other agents in the crew. This feature is automatically set up when there are multiple agents in the crew.

Asynchronous Execution
Tasks can be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing when appropriate. To create an asynchronous task, set async_execution=True when defining the task.

Memory and Caching
CrewAI supports both memory and caching features:

Memory: Enable by setting memory=True when creating the Crew. This allows agents to retain information across tasks.
Caching: By default, caching is enabled. Set cache=False to disable it.

Implementation :

The crew comprises of :
1. Agents : 2 (venue_finder , venue_quality_assurance_agent )
2. Tasks : 2 (find_venue_task , quality_assurance_review_task )
3. Tools : 1 (SerperDevTool)
4. Crew = Goal + Agents + Tasks + Tools 

Hyperparameters to play with : 

Agents : 
  max_iter=15,  # Optional
  max_rpm=None, # Optional
  max_execution_time=None, # Optional
  verbose=True,  # Optional
  allow_delegation=False,  # Optional
